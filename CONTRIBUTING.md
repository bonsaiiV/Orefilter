## Always test your changes
Do not submit your changes without running them.
When developing and compiling you could use a symbolic link (by running `ln -s <path to repository>/Orefilter/src/ Orefilter`).
When you have edited the datapack keep in mind to reload it either reopening the world or by running `/datapack disable "file/Orefilter"` followed by `/datapack enable "file/Orefilter"`.

## Style Guidlines
### Formatting
- All text files should end with a newline character
- Line ending should be Unix (LF) instead of Windows (CRLF)
- No spaces at the end of line

### Got a new reason when code was rejected?
If your code got rejected for an unlisted formatting reason please add it under [Formatting](#formatting).
